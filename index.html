            You will be given a random number at the start of the game.
    </br>
           There are four Boston Team Logos below. By clicking on a team, you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.
    </br>
           You win the game by matching your total score to the random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.
    </br>
           The value of each team is hidden from you until you click on it.
    </br>
           Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each team.
